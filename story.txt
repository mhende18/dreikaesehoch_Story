I was at the local ratskellar drinking bier when I decided that I wanted to buy a BMW. Before
I pulled the trigger on this purchase, I pulled out some Gebaeck from Berlin out of my bag and began munching on them
in a new BMW at a car dealership to get a feel for what it would be like to own this car - plus
I think clearest on a full stomach. To really seal the deal, I asked the salesmen if we could take a test drive to go
pick up my hund and get him some treats from the baeckerei where I got the Gebaeck earlier. The salesman reluctantly agreed
and we drove off on the Hauptstrasse when a wettbewerbsfaehig driver in a Porshe suddenly 
appeared in the lane next to us, revving his engine indicating that he wanted to race. I revved my engine to indicate I was up
to the task, but when the light turned green and I accelerated my Apfelkuchen fell out of my bag. I watched, horrified, as
it rolled under the brake pedal and locked it up tighter than the gates of Eltz. Suddenly the road had become the hockenheimring
and I was Sebastian Vettel; luckily I was wearing my lederhose. I made the descision to purchase the BMW and raced all the 
way home, then I put my key in the schloss and entered my home for a nice doener. After enjoying my meal I logged into slack
to see if Melhase had posted any updates for SER 316. To my surprise, teh slack had a schloss on it and she had not posted anything. 
After I finished my doener I gave my hund the treats I bought him earlier from the baeckerei. It was a very cool baeckerei 
because it was also in a biergarten.

after all this i got back into my nice fancy BMW
